Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that
uses V8 and is built in Rust.

- Secure by default. No file, network, or environment access, unless explicitly
enabled.

- Supports TypeScript out of the box.  - Ships only a single executable file.

- Has built-in utilities like a dependency inspector (deno info) and a code
formatter (deno fmt).

- Has a set of reviewed (audited) standard modules that are guaranteed to work
with Deno: [deno.land/std](https://deno.land/std)
