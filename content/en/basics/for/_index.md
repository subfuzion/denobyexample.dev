TypeScript supports three looping constructs:

- [for loop](./for_loop) - the classic way to loop.

- [for..of loop](./for_of) - for looping over iterable objects 

- [for..in loop](./for_in) - for looping over object properties

Iterating over collections of something is such a common programming
task, you will often find yourself using the **for..of** loop.

You'll find yourself using the classic **for loop** mostly in
situations where its syntax streamlines access to a loop counter
that's essential to your code implementation.

You will rarely need to iterate over an object's properties, but when
you do, you'll see that you can still use a **for..of** loop instead
of the more nuanced, legacy **for..in** loop.
