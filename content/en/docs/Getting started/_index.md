To get started, the prerequisites are modest! You will need to install
the following:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

* curl (for [Windows](https://curl.se/windows/); probably already pre-installed on [Linux](https://curl.se/download.html) and [macOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/curl))
