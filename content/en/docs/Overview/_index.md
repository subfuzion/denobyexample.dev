# Welcome!

If you're a programmer, do any of the following situations apply to you?

* You want to run an app (or toolchain) your machine, but you don't want to 
  install it.
* You want to connect to other services, like database servers, but you don't
  want to install them on your own machine (or maybe you want to test against
  multiple versions).
* You want to share your app with others, but it only runs in certain
  environments, or it has dependencies that must be installed first to be able
  to run.
* You want to deploy your app to a server somewhere where other users can
  connect to it, but you don't want to have to manage the installation of
  your app and its dependencies on the server.
* You want to be confident that what you package up will run the same way on
  each machine it runs on.

These are all scenarios that Docker can help you with. The key to unleashing
Docker's power is understanding how to write a Dockerfile. If you've seen
Docker commands or Dockerfiles and they seemed a bit arcane to you, don't 
be discouraged.

In this guide, you'll learn how write Dockerfiles so that you can containerize
just about anything. Unlike most other guides that focus on learning Docker
first before diving into writing a Dockerfile, we're going to invert that model.

Since you're a programmer, we're going to focus right off the bat on writing
Dockerfiles coming from a programmer perspective. We're going to build on a
series of examples that will develop your knowledge and confidence in writing
Dockerfiles.

We're going to start from ground zero and the only assumptions
are that you have a basic familiarity with using the command line in a terminal,
have a basic understanding of file systems and networking, and are using a 
programming (text-oriented) editor, like Visual Studio Code.
